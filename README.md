# Apple Privacy For Maui and Xamarin

The idea of this repository is to be a wiki of all the necessary settings in the app for each SDK to meet Apple's legal requirements.
Initially, we can list the name of the NuGet plugin and its configuration file so that each developer can create their own customized file to meet their app's needs.

**How to contribute:**

Make a PR with a folder named after the NuGet, and place the privacy file inside it. This makes it easier for us to consult all the involved packages.

LetÂ´s go folks
